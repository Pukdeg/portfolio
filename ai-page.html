                    <h4>MsC elective - 2024</h4>
                    <p>In this course, I dived into the world of artificial intelligence, exploring the state-of-the-art applications of AI in the built environment. I was introduced to various machine learning techniques and tasked with a design assignment aimed at applying one or more of these techniques to a project relevant to the design process.
                        The tool I developed addresses the current limitations in managing the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Urban designers and architects often lack tools to assess the potential impact of their interventions on the UHI effect. Traditional UHI maps are static, relying on large-scale measurements that quickly become outdated. Additionally, urban designers cannot predict temperature changes when replacing greenery with buildings or vice versa. I aimed to solve this by using machine learning to predict the UHI effect based on satellite images and aerial photos, providing real-time predictions of critical hotspots. This tool enables architects and urban planners to make more informed design decisions to minimize the UHI effect.

                    </div>
                    <div class="project-info">For this project, I used a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a machine learning technique well-suited for image-to-image translation tasks. The model was trained on pairs of images: satellite images as input and corresponding UHI maps as output. Essentially, the model learns the characteristics of the input images that influence the target images (UHI maps). After learning these characteristics, it can generate UHI maps from new satellite images.
                        I began by creating a large dataset of satellite images and their corresponding UHI maps. I divided the Netherlands into chunks of 2x2 kilometers, pairing the corresponding chunks to serve as input for training the model. The final dataset contained 8300 image pairs. After many days of experimenting with different training settings, I identified the best training configuration and selected the most effective model for testing and evaluation.

                <div class="project-info">
                    <p>The results were promising. The model accurately predicted areas without the UHI effect, producing a full blue image for rural landscapes, indicating no temperature increase. For urban landscapes, the model roughly predicted the location of hotspots and recognized the impact of greenery and water bodies on reducing the UHI effect. While the temperature predictions were somewhat accurate, they were not perfect, and the hotspot locations were not always precise. This could be due to the images lacking broader contextual information about their surroundings.
                        For experimental purposes, I also tested the model on images at a larger scale than it was trained on. Surprisingly, it managed to predict the UHI effect with reasonable accuracy on these larger-scale images as well. This suggests that the model can be scaled up by dividing larger maps into chunks and combining the predicted UHI maps to form a comprehensive larger map.

                    <h2>/ UHI Prediction Tests</h2>
                    <p>To further test the tool's utility for architects, I altered satellite images by replacing buildings with greenery and vice versa, then analyzed the effect on the UHI predictions. The results were encouraging. When replacing buildings with parks, the predicted UHI map showed a temperature reduction, indicating that the model could assess the impact of such interventions. Similarly, the model predicted an increase in temperature when greenery was replaced with buildings.
